# Tree Cousins

Check if two nodes are cousins in a Binary Tree 

Given the binary Tree and the two nodes say ‘a’ and ‘b’, determine whether the two nodes are cousins of each other or not. 

Two nodes are cousins of each other if they are at same level and have different parents. 

```
Example:

                      6

                  /     \

               3            5

            /     \      /    \

         7         8    1       2

7 and 1, result is TRUE

3 and 5, result is FALSE

7 and 5, result is FALSE
